# COMP464---Computer-Graphics
CSUCI Fall 2020
CSUCI Computer Science Program

Fall 2020
COPITART 464: Computer Graphics
Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to computer graphics. We will take a modular approach to build an in-browser graphics engine, which we will use to create a final project. We will work primarily in JavaScript and GLSL, with the help of WebGL (a JavaScript API for rendering graphics on the HTML canvas, which conforms closely to OpenGL 2.0). In the process we will cover the underlying mathematics, which will consist primarily of geometric principles and linear transformations necessary for conversions between local space, world space, and view space as well as lighting, texturing, reflection, refraction, and other visual effects.

Student outcomes:
After successfully completing this course, students will be able to:

Use the vector and matrix mathematics underlying the fundamentals of computer graphics.
Decide which calculations are best done on the CPU vs the GPU.
Understand and discuss conventions use to create consistency in visualized spaces and modelling.
Describe and differentiate between the different spaces through which models are transformed to be drawn.
Implement the transformations necessary to display multiple models in 3D space.
Texture a model by mapping it to an image.
Discuss and implement models for lighting, reflection and refraction.
Design and implement unique shaders to display unique materials.

Course Website:
The course is managed through CI Learn (Canvas). You can access the course information using your account at https://cilearn.csuci.edu/.  The detailed course schedule, lecture notes, lecture videos, assignments and announcements will be posted and maintained on CI Learn; students should check this site frequently.

Lecture Schedule:
Mondays 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm

Wednesdays 6:00 pm - 9:00 pm

 

Lectures will be held on Zoom at the designated times. Zoom invite links can be found in the lectures, found on the Canvas Calendar or in the Canvas Modules tab. Support will be provided to students attending asynchronously through video lectures and office hours. See "Attendance" section below.

Prerequisites:
Some programming experience is assumed. Students will be required to develop proficiency with basics in JavaScript and GLSL.

Instructor:
Ryan McIntyre

Communication Policy:
Asynchronous:

Zoom lectures will be recorded and linked to the lectures in Canvas.
Alternative online resources will be provided where possible.
Asynchronous communication will be maintained using Canvas messages and emails. Any emails sent from non-CI email accounts will not be recieved.
Emails should be sent to ryan.mcintyre466@myci.csuci.edu
I will respond to your inquiry within 24 hours except weekends (5 pm on Friday and 8 am on Monday) and holidays. If I do not reply in this time-frame, please assume that the message was not received and contact me again.
Synchronous:

Zoom lectures will be held at the scheduled class time.
Lectures can be joined through links found on the Canvas Calendar or the Canvas Modules tab.
Office hours will be held on Zoom at meeting ID 947 496 7899 at the following times:
Monday, 12pm-2pm
Tuesday/Thursday, 9am-11am & 7pm-8pm
Friday, 9am-11am & 12pm-2pm
The Zoom schedule, including office hours listed above, can be found in Module 0.
Instructional Approach and Course Structure:
This course will focus on application. Lectures will be brief (they will rarely take more than an hour) and extra time will be spend on labs. Ideally, students attending synchronously will need to spend little time on labs outside of the scheduled class hours, and will only need to complete the homework assignments outside of class.

Lectures:
Lectures will be given on Zoom.
Invite links to lectures can be found by clicking lectures on the Canvas Calendar or the appropriate Canvas Module.
Lectures will be recorded, and Zoom invite links will be replaced with links to the recordings shortly after lectures.
Links to alternative resources covering the same or very similar content will be provided for most lectures.
Kahoot quizzes will be held at the end of most lectures to solidify new material and review old material. Links to these quizzes will be included in the corresponding modules on Canvas.
Attendance:
Students will choose one of the following attendance policies before the second lecture. This choice is final, except in extenuating circumstances.

Standard Attendance: Attendance will be taken at some time during each lecture. Your attendance grade will be determined by your presence in the Zoom meeting at this time.
Async Attendance: Once per week, before Saturday at midnight, you will submit a 1-paragraph summary of each lecture given that week. Your attendance grade will be determined by your timely submissions of these summaries.
Homework Assignments:
Homework assignments will be given every 1-2 weeks (1-2 assignments per module).
Homework assignments will be released on the day of the first lecture for each unit, and will be due at midnight the night before the first lecture of the following unit.
Homework assignments will be graded based on completion. Students will not lose points for errors in attempted problems; problems which were not given an honest effort by the instructors determination, or which don't follow submission instructions, will not receive points.
Homework solutions will be released with or shortly after homework assignments are due.
Detailed feedback will only be given on homework assignments in person, if sought in office hours. Feedback on Canvas will consist of some brief commentary and a grade.
Collaboration on homework assignments is enoucouraged, but all submitted work must be written by you in your own words. Homework submissions will have a field in which you can list those you collaborated with, but this does not mean your solutions can be identical. All submissions are individual. Collaboration should come in the form of discussion and explanation, not "splitting" the assignment.
Homework Submission Requirements:
Homework assignment submissions will come in form of a single image or word document (pdf, png, doc, docx) showing all homework solutions. Assignments split into a collection of images will be rejected.
Homework assignments may be hand-written, as long as they are legible. However, cell phone pictures will be rejected. Scans of handwritten pages will be accepted. Free apps exist which will let you "scan" pages using your cell phone camera, and these are acceptable.
No late work will be accepted. Do not leave work until the last minute and then ask for an extension; it will not be granted unless the circumstances are exceptional. Submissions will not be accepted after solutions have been released in any circumstances; in the case of exceptional circumstances assignment grade may be dropped (max 2 per student).
Lab Assignments:
Lab assignments will be given every 1-2 weeks (1-2 assignments per module).
Lab handouts will consist of a zipped collection of javascript, html and glsl files, along with supporting assets. Files must be altered or completed, depending on the assignment.
Lab solutions will be released shortly after the assignments are due. Often, the following lab handout will consist of this solution with the skeleton of the new additions.
Much like homework assignments, collaboration is encouraged but all submitted work must be your own. You may explain solutions, and even show your solution to others (via screen sharing), but may not send any included files. Direct copying of others' solutions will result in a zero for both students; sharing should be limited to determining how to solve the problem, and not to copying down the solutions.
Lab Submission Requirements:
Lab submissions will consist of the lab handout, in its entirety, with whatever changes or additions you made to complete the assignment. All files, including those that you did not edit, are to be submitted.
The collection of submitted files should be compressed into a zip file.
Some labs can be verified for completion very easily; once the lab is complete, a scene will be visible. For these labs, students may submit in office hours by showing me their completed, functioning lab via screen sharing. This option will only be available when it is convenient; when office hours are busy, I will not be verifying labs.
No late work will be accepted. Do not leave work until the last minute and then ask for an extension; it will not be granted unless the circumstances are exceptional. Submissions will not be accepted after solutions have been released in any circumstances; in the case of exceptional circumstances the assignment grade may be dropped (max 2 per student).
Exams:
There will be two midterms and a final.
Exams will contain no programming tasks (though they may contain questions about the tools used in the labs).
Exams will come in two parts: online and written.
The Online Exam:
On Canvas
Multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false, short answer.
Available for 3 days.
90 minute time limit (once started).
The Written Exam:
On paper, tablet, LaTeX, ...
A few longer or more challenging questions.
Available for 3 days.
No time limit other than the 3 day availability.
See Homework Submission Requirements.
It is recommended that you take exams during office or class hours, when I am available on Zoom. I cannot guarantee quick responses to clarifying questions through other forms of communication, and extensions will not be given because clarifying questions were not responded to on time.
Refer to the Canvas Calendar or the Canvas Modules for exam dates. Exams are to be done individually, and written portions will be curved. You may not communicate with anyone about the exam until it has been graded, at which point an announcement will be made, but otherwise have access to all resources.

Any violation of these or any other rules of the academic code, will result in automatic "F" and the offenders will be reported to the Judicial Affairs. If multiple individuals are involved in the violation (e.g., two students submit same, or in the judgement of the instructor very similar, work), then all will be sanctioned.

Projects:
In a sequence of labs throughout the semester, we will build an engine which we can use to display, texture, and add effects to models in a 3D space. This engine will serve as a starting point for your final project.

Projects can be done in groups of 1-3. Group sizes can be increased beyond 3 if the size of the project merits the additional people.
Project Proposals will be due before the second midterm (see Canvas Calendar). These will explain your intended project and list your group members. Only one proposal needs to be submitted per group. Proposals may require some editing before they are accepted.
The project due date and project presentations will occur during finals week. (The final exam is during dead week. See the Canvas Calendar).
Project presentations will occur on Zoom. They may either be done via live demonstration or via video recording.
There are two common final project archetypes:
Build a display:
Use the engine that we've built to create something beautiful.
Does not require adding new functionality (though most end up adding some anyway).
Usually entails building and texturing a collection of models and related shaders.
Often entails scripting some motion or procedurally defining some object behavior to get those finishing touches.
Some common examples:
A solar system display
A city fly-through
A level from a favorite video game
A scene from a favorite movie
Create new features:
Add functionality to the engine that we've built.
Create a demonstration to show off your new functionality.
Some examples:
Create a basic video game (or, more accurately, the necessary components to create a 1-level game demo). While the game mechanics can be 2D, the displayed models should be 3D. This usually entails implementing collision detection of some sort.
Add a few features that are "just out of reach" with the current engine (shadow mapping, dynamic reflections, occlusion lighting, ...)
Create a system to procedurally generate, display and navigate an environment (think Minecraft without game mechanics).
Create a display for something complex and unique (water, fire, procedurally generated trees that sway in the breeze...)
Grading:

The instructor reserves the right to adjust any grade in response to any new forthcoming relevant information that was unknown when the grade was determined. For example, if a student submitted work that was not based on their efforts, and that becomes known at some later time, then the grade will be changed accordingly.

Grade Letter Scheme:

The following grading scheme is used in this course:

98 - 100% - A+
94 - 97.99% - A
90 - 93.99% - A-

anything below 61% - F

You have access to your grades in Canvas at all times to track your progress and are always welcome to contact the instructor with questions or concerns.

Grading Policy:

All exam work must be your own. Homework may be collaborative, but not shared. Your submitted work must be written, in its entirety, by you.. Plagiarism, defined as copying or receiving materials from a source or sources and submitting this material as one's own without acknowledging the source, or otherwise representing the work of others as your own, is NOT allowed and will result in 0% for the assignment. Sharing exam solutions with other students is also considered an Academic Dishonesty.
Any violation of these or any other rules of the academic code, will result in automatic "F" and the offenders will be reported to the Judicial Affairs. If multiple individuals are involved in the violation (e.g., two students submit same, or in the judgement of the instructor very similar, work), then all will be sanctioned.
Students will submit assignments, including exams, in Canvas. Other submissions (e.g., through email) will not be accepted.
Students should be prepared to defend their work; the instructor may initiate a discussion of the exams after the submission.
Community Rules:
In an effort to ensure our learning community develops, thrives and sustains throughout our time together, the following ground rules will be in effect at all times.

As a student in this program, you agree to:

Consider yourself a member of a community. A community is a group of individuals who work together to support a common goal or interest. We are working together to support the successful achievement of our learning outcomes.
Treat the diverse contributions made by other community members with respect.
Have patience and a sense of humor with technology. There will be hiccups, expect them.
Be a learner. Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may challenge your perceptions.
Ask for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.
Understand that communications shared through text have a higher likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken. Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it's phrased, re-write it.
Contribute regularly to group dialogue. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the collective strength and diversity of our community.
Treat others with decency. Respect others' boundaries.
If a Ground Rule is Violated

If, at any time, you feel that any of these ground rules has been violated by a member of our community, you are encouraged to bring your concern directly and immediately to your instructor. In your message, you may identify which ground rule has been violated and include specific evidence of the violation in your email, if you feel comfortable doing so. Otherwise, you are entitled to ask for references to appropriate campus personnel better equipped to handle such situations. Your concerns will be addressed promptly and with careful consideration.
